# Grapes

Built on React, Grapes is a mock job posting board (CRUD) where developers can search for industry related job postings. Within the app, there is an employer's portal where users can submit job postings through a validated form. A Node.js server runs behind the scenes to scrape data from LinkedIn and Indeed, and then populates the new data onto Firebase.
